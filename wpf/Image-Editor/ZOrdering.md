# Z ordering in WPF ImageEditor (SfImageEditor)

The image editor allows you to change the position of shapes that are arranged in the editor. This can be achieved using the following methods:

1. BringToFront
2. SendToBack
3. BringForward
4. SendBackward

## BringToFront

This method brings the selected shape to the front of all the shapes added in the image.

{% tabs %} 

{% highlight C# %} 

        editor.BringToFront(); 

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %} 

## BringForward

This method brings the selected shape to one step forward from its current position.

{% tabs %} 

{% highlight C# %} 

         editor.BringForward(); 

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %} 

## SendToBack

This method pushes the selected shape to the back of all the shapes added.

{% tabs %} 

{% highlight C# %} 

       editor.SendToBack();

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %} 

## SendBackward

This method pushes the selected shape one step back from its current position.

{% tabs %} 

{% highlight C# %} 

       editor.SendBackward();  

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
