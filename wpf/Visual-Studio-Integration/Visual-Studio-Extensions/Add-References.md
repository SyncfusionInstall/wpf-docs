It can also migrate the projects that contain the old versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference to newer or specific versions of the Syncfusion assembly reference. It supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher. This Visual Studio extension is included from Essential Studio 2013 Volume 3 release.
