IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;
//sets direction as Top
graphinfo.Commands.AlignTop.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Spacing

Spacing commands enable you to place selected objects on the page at equal intervals from each other. The objects are spaced within the bounds of the first and last objects in the selection.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Equally spaces the selected nodes horizontally
graphinfo.Commands.SpaceAcross.Execute(null);

//Equally spaces the selected nodes vertically
graphinfo.Commands.SpaceDown.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Sizing

Object size commands will be resized all selected object based on width, height and size of the first object in the selection list.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Scales the selected items to the size of first selected object
graphinfo.Commands.SameSize.Execute(null);

//Vertically scales the selected items to the height of first selected object
graphinfo.Commands.SameHeight.Execute(null);

//Horizontally scales the selected items to the width of first selected object
graphinfo.Commands.SameWidth.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Clipboard

Clipboard commands are used to perform Cut, Copy and Paste operations. 

Clipboard commands allow you to cut or copy selected Diagram objects to the Clipboard and paste the valid Clipboard content into the Diagram.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;
//Cuts the selected elements from the Diagram to the Diagram’s clipboard
graphinfo.Commands.Cut.Execute(null);

//Copies the selected elements from the Diagram to the Diagram’s clipboard.
graphinfo.Commands.Copy.Execute(null);

//Pastes the Diagram’s clipboard data (nodes/connectors) into the Diagram.
graphinfo.Commands.Paste.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Zoom

Zoom commands are used to zoom-in and zoom-out the Diagram view.

To execute zoom commands, parameters of type IZoomParameter ([IZoomManipulationParameter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr//wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.ZoomManipulationParamenter.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Diagram_ZoomManipulationParamenter_members), [IZoomPositionParameter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr//wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.ZoomPositionParameter.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Diagram_ZoomPositionParameter_members), or [IZoomPointerParameter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr//wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.IZoomPointerParameter.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Diagram_IZoomPointerParameter_members)) have to be passed.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Zoom to a particular scale.
graphinfo.Commands.Zoom.Execute(new ZoomPositionParameter() 
{ 
	ZoomTo = 2, ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.ZoomOut 
});

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Reset

Reset commands are used to reset horizontal Offset, vertical Offset, and zoom level of the Diagram. To execute a reset command, a parameter of type [IReset](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.ResetParameter.html) has to be passed.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

// Reset the Zoom level of the Diagram
graphinfo.Commands.Reset.Execute(new ResetParameter() { Reset = Reset.Zoom });

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Undo and Redo

The Undo command reverses the last editing action performed. For example, some of the basic operations performed on diagram objects such as translation, rotation, resizing, grouping, ungrouping, changing z-order, addition, deletion, and so on, can be reversed. The Redo command restores the last editing action if no other actions have occurred since the last undo.

Undo and Redo actions are disabled by default, to enable this you can use `Constraints` property of the SfDiagram.  Please refer to the [GraphConstraints](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.GraphConstraints.html)

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

// To enable the Undo and Redo action
diagram.Constraints |= GraphConstraints.Undoable;

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//To perform the Undo action in Diagram
graphinfo.Commands.Undo.Execute(null);

//To Perform the Redo action in Diagram
graphinfo.Commands.Redo.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Nudge

Nudge commands move the selected elements towards up, down, left or right by 1 pixel. [IMoveParameter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.MoveParameter.html) is provided to customize the movement of the selected objects. The Nudge Commands as follows.

| Commands | Description |
|---|---|
| NudgeUp | The NudgeUp command moves the selected object towards the top by 1 pixel. |
| NudgeDown | The NudgeDown command moves the selected object towards the bottom by 1 pixel. |
| NudgeLeft | The NudgeLeft command moves the selected object towards the left by 1 pixel. |
| NudgeRight | The NudgeRight command moves the selected object towards the right by 1 pixel. |

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;

//Nudge up the selected objects
graphinfo.Commands.MoveUp.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## FitToPage

FitToPage commands are used to bring the entire Diagram into the view. [IFitToPage parameter](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.FitToPageParameter.html) is provided to customize the FitToPage.
If the parameter is null, entire Diagram is fit into the view.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

IGraphInfo graphinfo = diagramcontrol.Info as IGraphInfo;
//To fit the Diagram into the view
graphinfo.Commands.FitToPage.Execute(null);

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Command Manager
Command manager is used to map between user gestures (keyboard, mouse) with commands. Refer to the following table for built-in commands with Key Gesture and Mouse Gesture.

List of Commands and Key Gesture:

| Command | Key | Key Modifiers |
|---|---|---|
| Copy | C | Control |
| Cut | X| Control |
| Paste | V | Control |
| Duplicate | D | Control |
| Undo | Z | Control |
| Redo | Y | Control |
| MoveLeft | | Left |	
| MoveRight | |	Right |	
| MoveUp | | Up |	
| MoveDown | | Down |	
| Delete | | Delete |	
| SelectAll | A	| Control |
| Group| G|	Control |
| UnGroup | G | Control |
| SendToBack | [ | Control+Shift |
| SendBackward | [ | Control |
| BringToFront | ] | Control+Shift |
| BringForward | ] | Control |

#### List of Commands and Key Gestures with Parameter

| Command | Key | KeyModifier | Parameter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zoom | - | Control | new ZoomPositionParameter { ZoomCommand=ZoomCommand.ZoomOut} |
| Zoom | + | Control | new ZoomPositionParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.ZoomIn } |
| Reset | 0 | Control | new ResetParameter { Reset = Diagram.Reset.ZoomPan } |
| FitToPage | 0 | Control+ Menu | new FitToPageParameter { FitToPage = Diagram.FitToPage.FitToPage, Margin = new Thickness(20) } |

#### List of Commands and Mouse Gesture with Parameter

| Command | Scroll State | Parameter |
|---|---|---|
| Vertical Scroll using ‘Zoom’ command | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.VerticalScroll} |

#### List of Commands and Key and Mouse Gesture with Parameter

| Command | KeyModifier | Scroll State | Parameter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Horizontal Scroll using ‘Zoom’ command | Shift | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.HorizontalScroll} |
| Zoom | Control | Scroll | new ZoomPointerParameter { ZoomCommand = ZoomCommand.ZoomIn `|` ZoomCommand.ZoomOut} |

N> When different commands are registered for the same key / mouse gestures, you need to handle the command while execution.

### Custom command

CommandManager provides support to define custom commands. The custom commands are executed, when the specified key gesture is recognized.
The [GestureCommand](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.GestureCommand.html) and [Gesture](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Diagram.Gesture.html) helps to define a custom command.

The following code example represents how to define custom command to Save Command (Control + S).

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}

//To define the mouse and keyboard gesture for the commands
GestureCommand saveGesture = new GestureCommand()
{
    //Define the command with custom command
    Command = Save,
    //Define gesture for custom Command
    Gesture = new Gesture
    {
        KeyModifiers = ModifierKeys.Control,
        KeyState = KeyStates.Down,
        Key = Key.S
    },
    //Parameter for command - file name for save command
    Parameter = "diagram"
};

//Add the custom command to the existsing command collection.
diagram.CommandManager.Commands.Add(saveGesture);
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
